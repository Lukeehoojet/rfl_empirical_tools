Of course almost a year has passed since that was written, soRustandRustforLinuxhas made further improvements, but presumably you don't mean that these things somehow became mandatory in the last 12 months
Linuxhas a minimum version requirement for gcc (or clang) that gets raised pretty often. I believe it's at 5.1 right now:  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210910234047.1019925-2-nde...  
 
So in practice, the _current_Linuxpolicy is worse thanRust. Instead of a well-defined edition, the kernel depends on an informal
Here's the (documentation for the)RustforLinuxalloc crate: https://rust-for-linux.github.io/docs/alloc/index.html

As you will notice, inRustforLinuxthe alloc crate's APIs lack functions such as new() which are infallible, and instead only provide the fallible try_new() function, whereas in conventionalRustyou can choose.
Linuxkernel. Of course they'd still need to be code-reviewed and maybe adapted slightly for the specific environment they're being used in, and there's social questions about who will maintain the code and what their priorities are, but the same applies to new code that's written exclusively forLinux. Starting from an existing well-designed well-tested library should achieve the same quality with less work than starting from scratch.Rust

I don't see future ofRustin kernel before this happens. In order to reach mainlineLinux,Rustneeds to have major changes to the more "conservative" side on how the language
